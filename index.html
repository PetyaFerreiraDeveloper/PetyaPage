                <h2> Education and IT</h2>
                <p> I have graduaded Bachelors and Masters degrees in Accounting, Strategy and Control, from universities
                    both in Denmark and Bulgaria. Currently I follow a software engineer program from Software
                    University. </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, VS Code, Github, DOM</li>
                        <p> In the last 10+ years, besides my full time job in business and finance, I have been taking
                            numerous
                            courses in Coursera,
                            freeCodeCamp, w3schools, LinkedIn and Udemy.
                        </p>
                        <li>Microsoft Office</li>
                        <p> As a bonus, I have 20+ years of professional experience with most MS Office applications.
                            Excel,
                            Word and Powerpoint are my strongest suits.
                        </p>
                        <li> Power BI and Qlik</li>
                        <p> 1+ year professional experience</p>
                        <li> Non IT languages</li>
                        <p> I speak fluently English and Danish. I am comfortable in having basic conversation in
                            Portuguese and my native language is Bulgarian. This knowledge opens up many doors and
                            opportunities.
                            But most often I come to enjoy the perks of being multilingual when I travel.

                <h2> Interests</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> IT Development</li>
                <p> Currently I am building a mobile app which can help parents by answering their questions regarding
                    the development of their babies. I have so many ideas and projects I want to work on, projects which
                    will hopefully make people's life easier.
                </p>
                <li id="travel"> Travel</li>
                <p> Is it a ski vacation in Italy, trekking in the mountains in New Zealand, road trip across USA, big
                    city break in Tokyo or just relaxing on the beach in Rio de Janeiro- Count me in! I love it and
                    enjoy the freedom travelling gives me. I love getting to know places and cultures, to taste the
                    food, to listen to the local music. This is also where the languages I speak, come in handy. My
                    travel focus currently though is Denmark.
                </p>
                <li> Building and construction</li>
                <p> Since international travel has been very limited in the last year, me and my family have invested in
                    a beautiful house in Hvidovre. I enjoy working on house projects and fixing things around.
                </p>
                <li> Writing </li>
                <p> I wrote a short children book for my 2-year old son. This project is work in progress, but I am
                    looking for someone who can make the illustrations. And then I will get it published.
