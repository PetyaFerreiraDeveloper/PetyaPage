                    <h3> Education and courses</h3>
                    <p> I have graduaded Bachelor and Masters degree in Accounting, Strategy and Control,
                        in university both in Denmark and in Bulgaria. Besides the formal education, 
                        i keep educating myself in the following subjects:
                    <li> HTML, CSS, JS, Phyton, VS Code, Github</li>
                    <p> In the last 10+ years, besides my full time job in business and finance, I have been taking numerous courses in Coursera, 
                    freecodecamp, w3schools, LinkedIn. 
                    But just recently i decided to go 100% in, and make a career 
                    in IT Development. </p>
                    <li> Microsoft Office</li>
                     <p> As a bonus, I have 20+ years of professional experience with most MS Office applications.
                         Excel, Word and Powerpoint are my strongest suits.

                        Portuguese and my native language is Bulgarian. This knowledge opens and 
                        many doors and opportunities. But most often I come to enjoy the perks of being multilingual

                    <h3> Interests</h3>
                    <li id="travel"> Travel</li>
                    <p> Is it a ski vacation in Italy, trekking in the mountains in New Zealand, 
                        road trip across USA, big city break in Tokyo or just relaxing on the beach in Rio de Janeiro- Count me in!
                        I love it and enjoy the freedom travelling gives me. 
                        I love getting to know places and cultures, to taste the food, 
                        to listen to the local music. This is also where the languages I speak, 
                        come in handy. My travel focus currently though is Denmark.
                    </p>
                    <li> Building and construction</li>
                    <p> Since international travel has been very limited in the last year,
                        me and my family have invested in a beautiful house in Hvidovre.
                        I enjoy working on house projects and fixing things around.
                    </p>
                    <li> IT Development</li>
                    <p> Currently I am building a mobile app which can help parents by 
                        answering their questions regarding the development of their babies.
                        I have so many ideas and projects I want to work on, projects which 
                        will hopefully make people's life easier.
                    </p>
                    <li> Writing </li>
                    <p> I wrote a short children book for my 2-year old son. 
                        This project is work in progress, but I am looking for someone 
                        who can make the illustrations. And then I will get it published.
